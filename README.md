## 📌 Overview

Financial fraud detection remains one of the most critical challenges in modern data-driven economies. Traditional classification models often fail when dealing with highly imbalanced credit datasets, where fraudulent transactions represent a small minority.

IDCOST introduces a scoring-based SVM framework specifically engineered to enhance sensitivity, reduce computational complexity, and optimize data criterion service in imbalanced credit environments.

This research proposes a structured pipeline covering preprocessing, training, validation, and testing — delivering higher detection accuracy for credit card fraud and default prediction compared to conventional SVM-based approaches.

## 🚨 The Problem

Imbalanced credit datasets suffer from:

- Severe minority class under-representation
- High false-negative rates in fraud detection
- Feature redundancy
- Computational overhead
- Poor sensitivity in traditional SVM models

In financial systems, even small classification errors can translate into millions in losses.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution: IDCOST Methodology

IDCOST integrates:

- Index-based feature selection
- Detector threshold clustering
- Cluster-head optimized classification
- Sensitivity-aware model validation
- Kernel modification in SVM
- Sample-level scoring in test phase

The model operates across four major stages:

1. Pre-processing (Detector Threshold Clustering)
2. Training (Sensitivity Optimization + Feature Validation)
3. Validation (Model Stability Evaluation)
4. Testing (Scoring-Based Classification)

## 🔬 Technical Contributions

- Improved sensitivity for fraud detection
- Reduced computational complexity
- Balanced feature representation
- Reduced data redundancy
- Optimized SVM kernel performance
- Cluster-head guided classification mechanism
- Load balancing in classification layers

## 📊 Why It Matters

Financial institutions process millions of transactions daily.

Even a 1% improvement in fraud detection sensitivity can result in:

- Reduced financial losses
- Better regulatory compliance
- Improved trust in digital payment systems
- Lower false-positive operational costs

IDCOST directly addresses real-world financial AI deployment challenges.
